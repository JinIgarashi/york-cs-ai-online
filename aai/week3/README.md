# 3.3.1 exercise

## Task

Given the 50 cities and the pairwise cost of travelling to those cities, implement the simple hill climbing algorithm. Run the algorithm 10 times and report back the results. One way to report back the results is to present the convergence of the cost function. This must be done using the distance matrix of 50 cities provided with this activity.

- Step 1 : Initial Solution: You can construct your own initial solution (based on either the random or greedy approach).
- Step 2 : Neighbourhood operator: Do a swap of two adjacent cities
- Step 3 : Solution evaluation: Add the cost of travelling through the cities
- Step 4 : Stopping criteria: No improvement is 25 iterations

## Usage

```commandline
pipenv install
pipenv run python 3.3.1_tsp.py
```

## Results

1. Greedy approach to make initial solution.

As result, initial solution looks like already the best solution. After 10 times trials, there are no changes of travel cost and paths at all.
